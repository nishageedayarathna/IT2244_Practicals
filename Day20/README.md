## (01). Shared Memory (Synchronization)
What it is: Multiple processes use a common memory space to read and write data. How it works: You need to synchronize the access (like using locks) to prevent two processes from messing up the data. Example: Two programs can share a fileâ€™s contents in memory, but they must wait their turn to read/write to it.
